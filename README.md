# A snowman using WebGL

This is a simple testing code to draw some geometrical 3D figures. In this case is a snowman lit using Phong, also a plane-texture composed the floor. 
>The snow man is not complete! (still missing his scarf and carrot-nose).

It was written in WebGL, shaders are in the `index.html` file, and the *core* is in the `script.js`. The code is not **elegant**: to write in the todolist. I am using the `MV.js` extracted from [Angel's code](https://github.com/esangel/WebGL/tree/master/Common) to handle the matrix and vector in Javascript

Keys (or buttons) `w` and `s` are able to zoom in/out fromt the camera point of view. I tested on Firefox and Chrome.
